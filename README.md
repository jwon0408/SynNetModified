# SynNetModified
This is a modified version of SynNet developed by Pejminister (https://github.com/cbg-ethz/SynNEt). Currently, it contains new functions to automate the matching miRNA names to sequences from miRBase versions 9.0-21.0. It also contains functions to combine multiple miRNA expression data from different literature based on the identified sequences. The program input files are modified, and the interface of the combined miRNA data to the main program is also adjusted accordingly. More modifications will be made in the future.
